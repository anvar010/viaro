## Resolved — the driver earnings question

The diagram's gap (60 + 40 = the whole fare, yet the driver must also be paid) is answered:
**the driver is paid by whoever owns them, out of that owner's share.** Company drivers are
paid by their company from its 60%; unrostered drivers are paid by the admin from the
platform share. Per-trip rates are set by the owner on the Driver record. Implemented and
tested in [wallet.service.ts](src/modules/wallet/wallet.service.ts).

## Open — needs a key or a decision, not code

Providers are fully implemented; they only need credentials in `.env`.

- [ ] **Payment gateway key** — `stripe` adapter ready (`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_*`)
- [ ] **Flight data key** — `aviationstack` / `flightaware` adapters ready (`FLIGHT_API_*`)
- [ ] **SMS & push key** — `twilio` / `firebase` / `expo` adapters ready (`SMS_PUSH_*`)
- [ ] **S3 bucket** for driver licence & insurance uploads
- [ ] **Deployment target** — server/subdomain (confirmed *not* `x1.xelocorp.com`)
- [ ] **Confirm the split direction** — the UML says Company **60** / Admin **40**, which is
      what the code defaults to. Flip `COMPANY_REVENUE_PCT` / `ADMIN_REVENUE_PCT` in `.env`
      if you meant the other way round.
- [ ] **Automatic payouts** — does a scheduled payout carry the same 10% fee as a manual withdrawal?
