/**
 * Re-renders the page it sits on when the API says something relevant changed.
 *
 * These pages are Server Components, so there is no client-side fetch to repeat —
 * `router.refresh()` re-runs the server render and React reconciles the result, which
 * keeps every access decision on the server where it belongs. Nothing in this file ever
 * touches booking data.
 *
 * Plain EventSource, unlike the consoles: the stream is proxied through /api/events on
 * this same origin, so the browser sends the httpOnly session cookie automatically and
 * no token has to be handed to JavaScript. EventSource also reconnects on its own,
 * which is why there is no retry logic here.
