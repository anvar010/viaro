# Viaro Backend — Full Build Spec

Rechecked against `Viaro_RideHailing_UML_UseCase.svg` end-to-end: 4 human actors, 2 system actors, 12 use-case groups, all `<<include>>`/`<<extend>>` links, and all 7 UML notes. This is the complete spec to start building from — one backend, role-based, no per-actor folder split (per earlier discussion). Any endpoint the diagram implies but doesn't fully specify (payment gateway, flight API, SMS/push) is marked **PLACEHOLDER** — build the route now, wire the real provider later.

## 1. Stack

- Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Redis (driver geolocation, BullMQ queue backend, session/token blacklist)
- Socket.io (dispatch, live tracking, chat, notifications)
- BullMQ (penalty timer, cancellation-window checks, scheduled payouts, report generation)
- JWT (access + refresh), bcrypt
- Deployment: your existing aaPanel + Git auto-deploy VPS flow — **note: not `x1.xelocorp.com`, that's a different project's box; this needs its own subdomain/server decided separately**

## 2. Roles & RBAC matrix

| Endpoint group | customer | driver | admin | company |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Booking | ✅ own | ❌ | 👁 read all | 👁 read all |
| Trip lifecycle | 👁 own | ✅ own | 👁 all | 👁 all |
| Pricing (set) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Wallet | ✅ own | ✅ own | 👁 all | 👁 all |

Enforced via `authGuard` (JWT verify) + `roleGuard(...roles)` middleware on every route below.

## 8. Hard-coded Business Rules (diagram notes 1–7)

1. Every time comparison (booking, cancellation, refund) uses `America/Los_Angeles` — one shared util, never raw `new Date()`.
2. `Trip` responses strip `fareAmount` for role `driver`.
3. Refunds always credit wallet, never original payment method. 10% fee applies only on withdrawal; 0% when reused for next ride — two separate code paths.
4. `Trip`/`Booking` responses strip driver's real phone from customer payloads — use masked number or in-app chat.
5. Penalty = driver's ride alerts delayed 2 minutes; event visible on Admin & Company dashboards.
6. Refund thresholds: point-to-point & airport ≥24h → 90%; hourly ≥72h → 90%; below → no refund. One shared policy function parameterized by trip type.
7. Reports scoped by role: driver sees own only; admin/company see full/aggregate.

## 9. Build Order

1. Auth + Users + RBAC middleware
2. Booking + Pricing (no dispatch yet)
3. Dispatch + Socket.io wiring
4. Trip lifecycle + penalty job + live tracking
5. Wallet + revenue split + cancellation/refund policy engine
6. Notifications + Flight API integration (placeholder provider first, swap later)
7. Chat
8. Reports + Admin dashboard
9. Rating

## 10. Open Decisions Before Coding Starts

- Which Payment Gateway provider (affects `paymentGateway.ts` and webhook shape)
- Which Flight Data API provider (affects `flightApi.ts` request/response shape)
- Which SMS/push provider for notification delivery
- Hosting: confirmed **not** `x1.xelocorp.com` — need the actual target server/subdomain before deployment config is written

Everything else in this doc is buildable now without those answers — the placeholders keep the routes and service boundaries in place so swapping a provider later is a one-file change, not a refactor.
