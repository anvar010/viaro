 * Spec §8 states these as rules about roles, not about endpoints — but they were being
 * re-implemented per endpoint (trip.service.ts shaped a trip; reports.service.ts wrote
 * its own inline ternary for the same field). Two copies of a rule is one copy too many:
 * the third endpoint to return a fare is the one that forgets.
 *
 * Every response that carries one of these fields must go through the predicates here.
 * `tests/authorization.spec.ts` asserts them at the HTTP boundary, so a new endpoint
 * that bypasses this module fails the suite rather than leaking quietly.
