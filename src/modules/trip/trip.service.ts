 * PATCH /trips/:id/status — operations moving a trip by hand.
 *
 * The lifecycle belongs to the chauffeur; this exists for when reality and the record
 * disagree — a driver who finished the job and never pressed Complete, a trip that has
 * to be called off from the office. It is an override, so it is admin-only and it
 * records who asked for it.
 *
 * It deliberately runs the SAME side effects as the driver's own actions rather than
 * writing the status field directly:
 *
 *   - completing settles the fare (60/40 split, driver payout). Skipping that would
 *     leave a completed trip nobody was ever paid for.
 *   - either terminal state frees the driver back to 'available', or they stay 'busy'
 *     forever and dispatch never offers them work again.
 *   - the customer is notified, because from their side nothing distinguishes an admin
 *     completion from the driver's.
 *
 * One deliberate difference: an admin cancellation does NOT penalise the driver. The
 * driver penalty exists for a chauffeur abandoning a ride they accepted; an office
 * cancellation is not that, and applying it here would punish people for someone else's
 * decision.
