/**
 * Immediate session revocation.
 *
 * The refresh-token blacklist in auth.service handles logout, but it only stops the
 * *next* refresh — an access token already in the wild keeps working until it expires.
 * That left a real hole: `deleteOwnAccount` suspends the account, yet the caller's
 * access token stayed valid for the rest of its 15 minutes.
 *
 * Blacklisting individual access tokens is not possible here (their jtis are unknown at
 * suspend time), so this records a per-user cutoff instead: every token issued before
 * the cutoff is rejected. One small key per revoked user, and because any access token
 * older than the cutoff expires within the access-token lifetime anyway, the key only
 * needs to live that long — the set can never grow unbounded.
