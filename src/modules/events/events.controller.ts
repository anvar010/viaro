 * to each of them to carry "your list is stale" would be a large cost for a small
 * message. This endpoint needs no client library at all.
 *
 * Note that the payload deliberately carries no domain data — only a topic, an action
 * and an id. Clients re-read through the ordinary REST endpoints, so role-based response
 * shaping (a driver never seeing fareAmount, a customer never seeing a real phone
 * number) keeps applying exactly as it does everywhere else. A stream that pushed
 * documents would have to re-implement all of it and would eventually get it wrong.
