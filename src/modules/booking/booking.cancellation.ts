 * accepted, the chauffeur, and an operator from the console — and each used to write its
 * own partial version of the story. Two of them wrote nothing at all, so a cancelled
 * booking in the admin console was just a status with no author.
 *
 * The trail is deliberately written to the Booking even when a Trip exists. Operations
 * lists bookings, a pending booking has no Trip to write to, and a single read path is
 * worth the duplicated field.
