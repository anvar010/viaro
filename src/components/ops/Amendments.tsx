 * Changes the customer made after booking.

 * given "Fairmont Olympic Hotel" cannot tell whether that was always the pickup or
 * replaced another address an hour ago, and an operator fielding "why is my driver at
 * the wrong place?" needs the before as much as the after.
 *
 * Rendered only when there is something to show — an unchanged booking gets no panel
 * rather than an empty one.
