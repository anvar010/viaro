 * A bookable vehicle class, owned by operations rather than by a constant in the source.
 *
 * This replaces the hard-coded table in config/vehicles.ts, which is now only the seed
 * for a fresh database. The multiplier in particular has to live here: it is pricing,
 * and pricing is a business decision that should not need a deploy to change — the same
 * reason city base fares are already a collection rather than a constant.
 *
 * `value` is the key stored on every Booking, so it is immutable once created and
 * unique. Renaming a class means changing `label`; changing `value` would orphan every
 * booking that referenced it, which is why the update route refuses it.
