 * Spec §8 rule 5 — the penalty timer.
 *
 * When a booking is broadcast to the public pool, a job is armed 2 minutes out. If no
 * driver has accepted by then, every driver who was offered the ride and stayed silent
 * gets a PenaltyEvent, and their subsequent ride alerts are delayed by 2 minutes.
 *
 * This lives in BullMQ rather than setTimeout deliberately: an in-process timer dies on
 * every deploy or crash, which would let a driver dodge penalties by timing a restart.
